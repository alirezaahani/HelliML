# Regression Linear Model for Estate Prices
## Introduction
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that implements a linear regression model on a dataset about estate prices. The notebook uses the scikit-learn library for machine learning, matplotlib for data visualization, and pandas for data manipulation.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this notebook is a collection of estate prices in a particular region. The dataset includes the following features:
- Location: The location of the estate (e.g. city, state, country)
- Price: The price of the estate
- Number of rooms: The number of rooms in the estate
- Area: The area of the estate
- Parking: Whather the estate has parking
- Warehouse: Whather the estate has warehouse
- Elevator: Whather the estate has access to elevator
## Model
The linear regression model is used to predict the price of an estate based on the other features in the dataset. The model is trained on a subset of the data and then used to make predictions on the remaining data.
